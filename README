noipextractor is a utility to decode the username and password stored in 
the configuration file of the noip2 program (often named noip2.conf).  
If you forgot your username or password to noip.com but you have a 
configured noip2 installation, you can use this utility to recover them.

Compile using make, and then use the executable for example as

    ./noipextractor /var/lib/noip2/noip2.conf

I have no clue what the licensing is because I wrote it by looking at 
the GPL noip2 source code, it includes 2-clause BSD licensed base64 
code, and it includes a url decoding function from stackoverflow (for 
which the content is CC-by-SA 3.0, but supposedly using a code snippet 
counts as fair use).  Therefore I release my code under any of the 
following that I am legally allowed to: the public domain, GPL version 2 
or later, 2-clause BSD, CC-by-SA 3.0.
